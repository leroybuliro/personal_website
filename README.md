# Project setup
## Running the python app on docker
In the terminal, change directory to the personal_website directory then run the command below to start the app container.

`docker compose up -d`

Confirm that the container is running using the ps command

`docker ps`

Output similar to the following should appear.

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                      NAMES

Use the stop command to stop the container. 

`docker stop <the-container-ids>`

Once the container has stopped, you can remove it by using the rm command.

`docker rm -f <the-container-ids>`
